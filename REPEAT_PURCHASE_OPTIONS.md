# 🛒 Multiple Purchase Policy Guide

## 🔍 **Current Restriction Explained**

Your KoraQuest system currently **prevents users from buying the same product multiple times**. Here's why and how to change it:

### **Current Logic:**
```python
# In post_detail view
has_purchased = Purchase.objects.filter(
    buyer=request.user, 
    product=post, 
    status__in=['completed', 'processing']
).exists()

# In template
{% if has_purchased %}
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        You have already purchased this product.
    </div>
{% endif %}
```

### **Business Reason for This Restriction:**
- 🔒 **Prevents duplicate orders**
- 💰 **Reduces payment disputes**  
- 📦 **Simplifies inventory management**
- 🎯 **Common for digital products or unique items**

---

## 🛠️ **Solution Options**

### **Option 1: Allow Unlimited Repeat Purchases** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Best for:** Physical products, consumables, gifts

```python
# Simple solution - always allow purchases
has_purchased = False  # Always allow purchases
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Users can buy multiple quantities
- ✅ Great for gifts or consumables
- ✅ Increases sales potential

**Cons:**
- ❌ May lead to duplicate orders
- ❌ Requires more careful inventory management

---

### **Option 2: Allow Repeat After Completion**
**Best for:** Services or items that can be reordered

```python
# Only prevent if there's a pending purchase
has_purchased = Purchase.objects.filter(
    buyer=request.user, 
    product=post, 
    status__in=['awaiting_pickup', 'awaiting_delivery', 'out_for_delivery']
).exists()
```

**Logic:** User can buy again only after their previous purchase is completed.

---

### **Option 3: Smart Purchase History Display**
**Best for:** Showing purchase history while allowing new purchases

```python
# Show purchase history but allow new purchases
user_purchases = Purchase.objects.filter(
    buyer=request.user, 
    product=post
).order_by('-created_at')

has_pending_purchase = user_purchases.filter(
    status__in=['awaiting_pickup', 'awaiting_delivery']
).exists()
```

**Template Update:**
```html
{% if user_purchases %}
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <i class="bi bi-info-circle-fill me-2"></i> 
        You have purchased this {{ user_purchases.count }} time(s) before.
        <small class="d-block mt-1">Last purchase: {{ user_purchases.first.created_at|date:"M d, Y" }}</small>
    </div>
{% endif %}

{% if has_pending_purchase %}
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <i class="bi bi-clock-fill me-2"></i> 
        You have a pending order for this product.
    </div>
{% endif %}

<!-- Always show buy button if in stock and not owner -->
{% if post.inventory > 0 and not is_owner %}
    <button class="btn btn-primary w-100">
        <i class="bi bi-bag-plus me-2"></i> 
        {% if user_purchases %}Buy Again{% else %}Buy Now{% endif %}
    </button>
{% endif %}
```

---

### **Option 4: Quantity-Based Approach**
**Best for:** Bulk purchases and inventory management

```python
# Calculate total quantity user has purchased
total_purchased = Purchase.objects.filter(
    buyer=request.user, 
    product=post,
    status__in=['completed', 'processing']
).aggregate(total=Sum('quantity'))['total'] or 0

# Set a reasonable limit (e.g., 10 per customer)
purchase_limit = 10
can_purchase_more = total_purchased < purchase_limit
remaining_allowance = purchase_limit - total_purchased
```

**Template:**
```html
{% if can_purchase_more %}
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <i class="bi bi-info-circle-fill me-2"></i> 
        You can purchase {{ remaining_allowance }} more of this item.
    </div>
    <button class="btn btn-primary w-100">Buy Now</button>
{% else %}
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <i class="bi bi-exclamation-triangle-fill me-2"></i> 
        You have reached the purchase limit for this product.
    </div>
{% endif %}
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach**

For a marketplace like KoraQuest, I recommend **Option 1 (Unlimited Repeat Purchases)** because:

### **Why This Makes Sense:**
1. **🎁 Gift Purchases**: Users might want to buy the same item for different people
2. **📦 Consumable Items**: Food, supplies, etc. can be reordered
3. **💰 Increased Revenue**: More sales opportunities
4. **🛒 Better UX**: Matches user expectations from other e-commerce sites
5. **📱 Quantity Control**: Users can still specify quantity in each order

### **How to Implement Safely:**
```python
# In post_detail view - Modified version
@login_required
def post_detail(request, post_id):
    post = get_object_or_404(Post, id=post_id)
    is_bookmarked = Bookmark.objects.filter(user=request.user, post=post).exists()
    is_owner = (post.user == request.user)
    auxiliary_images = ProductImage.objects.filter(product=post).order_by('display_order')
    
    # Get user's purchase history for this product (for reference)
    user_purchases = Purchase.objects.filter(
        buyer=request.user, 
        product=post
    ).order_by('-created_at')
    
    # Check if user has pending purchases (optional warning)
    has_pending = user_purchases.filter(
        status__in=['awaiting_pickup', 'awaiting_delivery']
    ).exists()
    
    # Always allow purchases (removed restriction)
    has_purchased = False
    
    context = {
        'post': post,
        'is_bookmarked': is_bookmarked,
        'has_purchased': has_purchased,
        'is_owner': is_owner,
        'auxiliary_images': auxiliary_images,
        'user_purchases': user_purchases,
        'has_pending': has_pending,
    }
    
    return render(request, 'authentication/post_detail.html', context)
```

## 📊 **Impact Summary**

### **What Changes:**
- ✅ **Before**: "You have already purchased this product" (blocked)
- ✅ **After**: Users can buy the same product multiple times
- ✅ **Inventory**: Still properly managed and decremented
- ✅ **Orders**: Each purchase creates a separate order
- ✅ **Pickup**: Each order has its own QR code and pickup process

### **What Stays the Same:**
- 🔒 Users still can't buy their own products
- 📦 Inventory limits still apply
- 💰 Payment processing works the same
- 📱 QR code system remains intact
- 🚚 Delivery/pickup options unchanged

---

## 🚀 **Result**

With the change implemented, users can now:
- 🛒 **Buy the same product multiple times**
- 🎁 **Purchase as gifts for different people**  
- 📦 **Reorder consumable items**
- 💯 **Specify different quantities in each order**
- 🏠 **Use different delivery addresses for each order**

Your marketplace now behaves like modern e-commerce platforms (Amazon, eBay, etc.) where repeat purchases are standard! 🎉
